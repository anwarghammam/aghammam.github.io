Hi, I am Dr.Anwar Ghammam, welcome to my academic space!

I am an assistant professor at [University of Michigan-Dearborn](https://umdearborn.edu/), United States, working at the Department of Computer Information and Science.

I founded and lead the NeoSE Lab. The name ‘Neo’ comes from the Greek néos, meaning new, modern, and innovative. It reflects the vision of our lab: pioneering the next generation of Software Engineering by creating intelligent and adaptive approaches for building and evolving software systems.” lab focuses on integrating Artificial Intelligence, and software evolution research with core software engineering practices. Our work advances the future of intelligent software, addressing key challenges in software quality, maintenance, and evolution.


**Research Interests**

Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE)
Software Engineering
Software Quality
Sofware Maintenance
Software Evolution

For more details about my research, please check my [publication list]([https://umdearborn.edu/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J4NPGMkAAAAJ&hl=en)).

I obtained my research master’s at Polytechnique Montréal, where I applied machine learning techniques to detect vulnerabilities in source code. My work was inspired by concerns over unintentional privilege protection changes that could introduce security vulnerabilities and expose sensitive data. My master’s thesis won the Best Student Paper Award. This work was supervised by Foutse Khomh. As a research assistant with Bram Adams, I contributed to continuous integration and machine learning pipelines, analyzing source code and build failures while working on the traceability of ML and source code artifacts.

I completed my engineering degree in Tunisia at the Higher Institute of Informatics, where I earned a government scholarship based on my exceptional academic achievements, enabling me to pursue studies in Canada.
